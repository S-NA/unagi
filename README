Please    refer    to    INSTALL    file    concerning    installation
instructions. Once you have built  the program, you can run it without
installing anything  by typing the  following command from  the source
directory:

./src/pcompmgr  -r rendering/.libs/ -p plugins/.libs/ -c pcompmgr.conf

At the moment,  only Awesome has been tested, you  may want to install
it in order to test the program.

You may  find the program  documentation in doc/ directory  in various
format (HTML, LaTeX and man pages).

Xephyr
======

You may  want to use Xephyr (nested  X server) as the  software is not
really stable (yet):

Xephyr -screen 1024x768 -ac -br :1

Then  run  the  command  given  in  the  previous  section  by  adding
DISPLAY=:1 at the beginning. You  may want to run other X applications
(such as  Awesome window manager)  by adding DISPLAY=:1 like  the main
program.
